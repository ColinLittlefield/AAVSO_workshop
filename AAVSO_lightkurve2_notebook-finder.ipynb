    "# **Extracting TESS light curves with `lightkurve`**\n",
    "## **AAVSO Data-Mining Workshop, Nov. 1, 2020**\n",
    "---------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "### Updated April 7, 2021: this version is compatible with the `mkpy3` finder-chart software as well as version 2.0 of `lightkurve`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook uses the interactive light-curve inspection tool from lightkurve to extract light curves from TESS data. I have structure it so that the user will not need to change any code in order to make it work; you do not need to know Python to execute it. I've divided this notebook into four blocks of code, which I've labeled as Cells A, B, C, and D. Simply run the three cells in order, following the instructions at the top of each cell. Cell D is optional; use it only if you want to create a datafile that can be loaded into Peranso.\n",
    "\n",
    "The major limitation with this notebook is its one-size-fits-all approach to background subtraction. This technique (applied in Cell C) works well enough for variable stars with large amplitudes, but for high-precision work, such as detecting exoplanet transits, a more sophisticated background-subtraction algorithm would be very helpful. This can be achieved, for example, with `lightkurve` or `eleanor`, but these approaches require some familiarity with Python.\n",
